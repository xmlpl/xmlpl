Description:  This program takes a simplified xml based iptables configuration and generates a
	BASH shell script that contains all the command to configure an iptables firewall.

Requirements:
XMLPL Development tools and libraries (www.xmlpl.org)

Compile:
xmlplcc iptables_gen.xpl

Run:
./iptables_gen < config.xml > iptables_config.sh

Files:
configs/* - Sample xml configuration files
iptables_gen.xpl - Main XMLPL program code

Notes:  
- Currently the supported action attributes are ACCEPT and DROP.  These must be
in all caps as they are directly passed to IPTABLES.
- URL remapping does not always behave as expected.  Some target sites look at
the browser URL to display content.  Since this is the URL of the original site
the target site gets confused.
- I have tested the included configurations on my firewall and they all function
as expected. Your milage may vary.

Sample Configuration:
<config>
        <interface type="public" device="eth1"/>
        <interface type="private" device="eth0"/>
        <rules default_action="DROP">
                <filter scope="public" action="ACCEPT" port="80"/>
                <filter scope="public" action="ACCEPT" port="22"/>
                <filter scope="public" action="ACCEPT" host="207.70.61.1" port="123"/>
                <filter scope="private" action="ACCEPT"/>
                <filter scope="private" action="ACCEPT" host="172.16.1.5"/>
                <nat enable="true"/>
                <reverse public_port="22" target_host="172.16.2.10" target_port="22" />
                <remap source_url="www.microsoft.com" target_url="www.linux.org" />
        </rules>
</config>
